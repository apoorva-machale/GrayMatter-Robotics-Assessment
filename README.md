# GrayMatter-Robotics-Assessment

Please use master branch code for testing.

Thank you for this opportunity.
It was challenging assessment. 
Steps how I came up with a solution:
1. First I read the problem thoroughly, and tried to understand the problem.
2. Later, I started reading the code given and anaylsing what does the puzzle, timer class do. Apart from that, I run the solution and understood how its calculating using randomwalk function. 
3. I googled and tried understanding the hill climbing algorithm and its types. It is similar to BFS.
4. And, then I tried solving it using Steepest-Ascent Hill climbing which first checks all the neighbouring nodes and then selects the node closest to the solution state as of the next node.
5. I were getting few errors and warnings, which I tried resolving it. 
6. And, before running out of time, I added the code to github, and further ran out of time to further think on stimulated annealing but I read the concept on it.


Thank you!
